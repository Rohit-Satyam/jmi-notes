1. Cumulative Frequency: https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/cumulative-frequency-distribution/
2. Histograms: [watch statquest](https://youtu.be/qBigTkBLU6g)
3. Distributions: Both histograms and curves are distributions. Curves show us how the probability of the measurements are distributed (Y axis represents the relative probability of a measurement). Advantages: If we don't have enough time and money and measurements, we still can have a curve that can fairly approximate how the distribution of measurements will look like. Also there might be some empty bins too without any measurement but still it gives probability of that bin too. [watch statquest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI3hZJqXJuc)
4.   The Normal Distribution: [watch statquest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzFX5NWojp0). The width of the Bell curve is ur standard deviation. ANd width in turn tell us how tall the curve will be. The wider the curver, the shorter the heigh of curve. The narrower the curve the taller.
